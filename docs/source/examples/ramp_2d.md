# Case Study: 2D Ramp (shock expansion)

Simplest case ramp at angle, $\theta$, with length, $L$.

Parameters $\mathbf{p} = [\theta, \, L]$

Calculate nominal pressure and forces.




## Free Stream Conditions

Use ideal gas air and a flow condition that approximates TUSQ

$$\gamma = 1.4$$

$$ Mach_{freestream} = 6$$

$$ P_{freestream} = 700 Pa$$

$$ T_{freestream} = 70 K$$
